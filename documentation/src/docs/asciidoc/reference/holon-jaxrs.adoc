== Introduction

The Holon Platform *JAX-RS* module provides support, components and configuration helpers concerning the link:https://github.com/jax-rs/spec/blob/master/spec.pdf[JAX-RS^] - _Java API for RESTful Web Services_.

The module provides *JAX-RS* implementations and integrations for platform foundation components and structures, such as the link:holon-core.html#RestClient[RestClient] API, server-side authentication and authorization using a link:holon-core.html#Realm[Realm] and a complete link:http://swagger.io[Swagger^] _OpenAPI_ support for data containers such as link:holon-core.html#PropertyBox[PropertyBox].

Regarding the *JSON* data-interchange format, this module uses the link:holon-json.html[Holon JSON module] to make available the Holon platform JSON extensions and configuration facilities for JAX-RS endpoints and clients, allowing to seamlessy use link:https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson^] or link:https://github.com/google/gson[Gson^] as JSON providers and provide support for _temporal_ types (including the `java.time.*` API) and the `PropertyBox` type out-of-the-box. 

Furthermore, the module makes available a set of *auto-configuration* features, both for the JAX-RS ecosystem and for the link:https://spring.io[Spring^] and link:https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot^] world.

A complete support for the most used JAX-RS implementations (link:https://github.com/jersey[Jersey^] and  link:http://resteasy.jboss.org[Resteasy^]) is provided, including Resteasy auto-configuration classes for Spring Boot integration.

== Obtaining the artifacts

The Holon Platform uses https://maven.apache.org[Maven^] for projects build and configuration. All the platform artifacts are published in the *Maven Central Repository*, so there is no need to explicitly declare additional repositories in your project `pom` file.

At the top of each _section_ of this documentation you will find the Maven _coordinates_ (group id, artifact id and version) to obtain the artifact(s) as a dependency for your project.

A *BOM (Bill Of Materials)* `pom` is provided to import the available dependencies for a specific version in your projects. The Maven coordinates for the core BOM are the following:

_Maven coordinates_:
[source, xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
<groupId>com.holon-platform.jaxrs</groupId>
<artifactId>holon-jaxrs-bom</artifactId>
<version>{revnumber}</version>
----

The BOM can be imported in a Maven project in the following way:

[source, xml, subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes+"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.holon-platform.jaxrs</groupId>
			<artifactId>holon-jaxrs-bom</artifactId>
			<version>{revnumber}</version>
			*<type>pom</type>*
			*<scope>import</scope>*
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

=== Using the Platform BOM

The Holon Platform provides an *overall Maven BOM (Bill of Materials)* to easily obtain all the available platform artifacts.

See link:index.html#obtain-the-platform-artifacts[Obtain the platform artifacts] for details.

[[WhatsNew51x]]
== What's new in version 5.1.x

* Improved support for the `java.time.*` Date and Time API data types when a `PropertyBox` type is serialized and deserialize as *JSON* in JAX-RS endpoints. See <<JSONMediaTypePropertyBox>>.

* The new `JaxrsAuthenticationInspector` API is available in JAX-RS endpoints to inspect current `Authentication` and perform authorization controls using a JAX-RS `SecurityContext`. See <<JaxrsAuthenticationInspector>>.

* Improved *Spring Boot* auto-configuration support for _Jersey_ and _Resteasy_ JAX-RS implementations. See <<JaxrsSpringBoot>>.

* Improved link:https://swagger.io[Swagger^] integration and auto-configuration, using Spring Boot application properties for easier configuration. See <<SwaggerSpringBoot,Swagger Spring Boot integration>>.

[[JaxrsPropertyBox]]
== `PropertyBox` serialization and deserialization support

The link:holon-core.html#PropertyBox[PropertyBox] type serialization and deserialization support for JAX-RS compliant servers and clients is available using the following _media types_:

* `application/json` - see <<JSONMediaTypePropertyBox>>
* `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` - see <<FormMediaTypePropertyBox>>

[[JSONMediaTypePropertyBox]]
=== JSON media type

The *JSON* serialization and deserialization support for the `PropertyBox` type is provided by the link:holon-json[Holon Platform JSON module]. Both https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson^] and link:https://github.com/google/gson[Gson^] JSON providers are supported.

To learn about `PropertyBox` type mapping strategies and configuration options see the link:holon-json#PropertyBox[PropertyBox] section of the Holon Platform JSON module documentation.

To enable the `PropertyBox` type support for JSON media type, just ensure that a suitable artifact is present in classpath:

* `holon-jackson-jaxrs` to use the *Jackson* library. See link:holon-json#JacksonJAXRS[Jackson JAX-RS integration] for details.
* `holon-gson-jaxrs` to use the *Gson* library. See link:holon-json#GsonJAXRS[Gson JAX-RS integration] for details.

The auto-configuration facilities provided by this two artifacts allow to automatically register and setup all the required JAX-RS features, both for link:https://github.com/jersey[Jersey^] and for link:http://resteasy.jboss.org[Resteasy^] JAX-RS implementations.

With the `PropertyBox` _JSON_ support enabled, you can write JAX-RS endpoints like this:

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/jaxrs/examples/ExamplePropertyBox.java[tag=json,indent=0]
----
<1> A `GET` endpoint method which returns a JSON-encoded `PropertyBox` instance
<2> A `GET` endpoint method which returns a JSON-encoded `PropertyBox` instances `List`
<3> A `PUT` endpoint method which accepts a JSON-encoded `PropertyBox` as body parameter. The `@PropertySetRef` annotation is used to specify the `PropertySet` to be used to decode the `PropertyBox` from JSON

[[FormMediaTypePropertyBox]]
=== Form/URLencoded media type

The `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` media type for `PropertyBox` serialization and deserialization is supported by default and auto-configured for _Jersey_ and _Resteasy_ when the `holon-jaxrs-commons` artifact is present in classpath.

You can explicitly configure the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` media type support in a JAX-RS server or client registering the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/jaxrs/media/FormDataPropertyBoxFeature.html[FormDataPropertyBoxFeature^].

CAUTION: Only *simple data types* (Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Enums and Dates) are supported for `PropertyBox` serialization and deserialization using the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` media type, so you cannot use complex property values (such as Java beans) as `PropertyBox` property values. The *JSON* media type is strongly recommended as `PropertyBox` data interchange format in a JAX-RS environment.

With the _form/urlencoded_ `PropertyBox` type support enabled, you can write JAX-RS endpoints like this:

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/jaxrs/examples/ExamplePropertyBox.java[tag=form,indent=0]
----
<1> A `POST` endpoint method which accepts a JSON-encoded `PropertyBox` as body parameter. The `@PropertySetRef` annotation is used to specify the `PropertySet` to be used to decode the `PropertyBox` from `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data

== Loggers

By default, the Holon platform uses the https://www.slf4j.org[SLF4J^] API for logging. The use of SLF4J is optional: it is enabled when the presence of SLF4J is detected in the classpath. Otherwise, logging will fall back to JUL (`java.util.logging`).

The logger names for the *JAX-RS* module are:

* `com.holonplatform.jaxrs` base JAX-RS module logger
* `com.holonplatform.jaxrs.swagger` for the _Swagger_ integration classes

== System requirements

=== Java

The Holon Platform JSON module requires https://www.java.com[Java] *8* or higher.

The _JAX-RS_ specification version *2.0 or above* is required.

This module is tested against link:https://github.com/jersey[Jersey^] version *2.x* and link:http://resteasy.jboss.org[Resteasy^] version *3.x*.
